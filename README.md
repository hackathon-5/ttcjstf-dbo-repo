We were attempting to build an application to where you could open the app. And a list of presidential candidates would 
load on the screen in a table list of pics and bio information to the left, along with a link to further into the candidates background.
Unfortunately my team ran into a snag using the API (converting it to a readible string) in the app.js file.
